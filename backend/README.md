# â‚¹iddhi API

A robust REST API backend for a personal finance tracker application built with Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB following domain-driven design principles.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, password reset, and profile management
- **Transactions Management**: Create, read, update, and delete financial transactions
- **Categories Management**: Organize transactions with customizable categories
- **Budget Planning**: Set and track budgets by category
- **Financial Goals**: Set and track financial goals
- **Account Management**: Track multiple financial accounts
- **Reports and Analytics**: Generate financial reports and insights
- **File Attachments**: Upload receipt images and documents for transactions

## Project Structure

The project follows a domain-driven design approach with the following structure:

```
/src
  /domains
    /auth                # Authentication and user management
    /transactions        # Transactions and categories
    /budgets             # Budget planning
    /goals              # Financial goals
    /accounts           # Account management
    /settings           # User preferences and settings
    /reports            # Financial reports and analytics
  /shared               # Shared utilities, middleware, and config
  app.ts                # Express application setup
  server.ts             # Server entry point
```

Each domain contains its own:

- Models (data structure)
- Services (business logic)
- Controllers (request handling)
- Routes (API endpoints)
- Middleware (domain-specific middleware)
- Types (TypeScript types and interfaces)
